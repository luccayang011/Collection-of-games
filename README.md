# A place where you can find various interesting games

I'm trying to improve my Python skill as a developer by learning more about how to leverage it to build something instead of just using packages to clean data & build models. So I enrolled the Python Bootcamp by Angela Yu - 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023.

These game ideas & start codes are provided by Angela Yu, and I completed/wrote all of them by my own. Please check out my progress!
